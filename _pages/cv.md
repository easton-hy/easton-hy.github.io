Course projects
======

Spatio-temporal Prediction based on Data-driven Machine Learning: Earthquakes Case
Module Name: Data-Driven Engineering and Machine Learning
------
  * Predicted the fluctuations of earthquake intensity with time based on machine learning (ML) and data from IoT.
  * Reduced high-dimensional systemâ€™s order using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). Used main-stream time serial prediction techniques including LSTM, RNN, and Transformer model.

Predicting Additive Manufacturing Parameters based on Acoustic Analysis
Module Name: Engineering Acoustics
------
  * Collected sound produced by different manufacturing parameters, and performed spectral analysis and data feature extraction on the sound.
  * Applied ML and data augmentation to improve accuracy, and compare the performance of different ML models.

Structural Design and Analysis of Quadruped Walking Robot
Module Name: Mechanical Design 1 Course Design
------
  * Modeled and simulated the walking mechanism of walking robot. Designed a innovated and optimized mechanism based on analysis.
  * Utilized Matlab to verify the values of inertia force and friction force in the walking mechanism.

Other Experience
