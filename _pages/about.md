Welcome to Easton's website! This website aims to provide you with a digital representation of myself, where you can get my experience in detail, including the presentation of my previous research projects, resume, and life. Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position and research assistant to dive myself into the research. It will be the beginning of my career, and I do try my best to qualify myself as a researcher with advanced state-of-the-art techniques in the research institution in the future.

Education
------
* M.Sc. Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 2023
* B.Eng. Mechanical Engineering, NUS (Suzhou) Research Institution, China, 2022
* B.Eng. Mechanical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, China, 2021

My education experience provides me with solid theory learning and extensive project practices. My skills are listed as below:
1. Modeling and structure design: Solidworks, AutoCAD, and Inventor.
2. Simulation and structure analysis: ANSYS (workbench and APDL) and Abaqus.
3. Numerical analysis and prediction: Matlab, Python, and SPSS.
4. Hardware: Sensor network, actuator modules, and Arduino.
5. Mobile app deployment: Android Studio.

Research Interests
------
My interests revolve around Digital Twins related area and their applications. More specifically, the areas are addressed as follows:
1. Smart sensing network and data transmission.
2. High-fidelity reduced-order model based on machine learning, such as the physics-informed neural network.
3. Augmented reality and data visualization.
4. Bidirectional communication between physical and virtual space.
5. Digital Twins system applications on the real infrastructures.
