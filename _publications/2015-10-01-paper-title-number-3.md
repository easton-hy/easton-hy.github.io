Abstract
------
Spatio-temporal (ST) earthquakes prediction is significant for prevention of damages. In this report, there is a dynamic high-dimensional dataset of SPR sampling from two-dimensional space. This report proposes a flow which can be used in general dynamic ST system. The flow includes dataset preprocessing based on analysis, two techniques to reduce the order of this system, and four prediction techniques. First, after visulizing the dataset and analyzing the dataset in space, time, and frequency aspects, the outliers, which are regarded as noise, are removed. Meanwhile, through system eigenvalue asnd energy of modes, system predictability is judged. Then, in order to reduce system complexity, order reduction techniques are applied. One of the reduction techniques is based on the PCA technique. Another is dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with Koopman which is widely applied in the dynamic system. Inversing of reduced order system is also important, this report compares the reduction techniques from accuracy of prediction and inversing accuracy. Finally, the main-stream black box time series models, including LSTM, RNN, and Transformer, are applied. Those black box models are compared with white box technique which is dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with Koopman.

**Keywords:** Spatio-temporal Prediction, Reduced-order model, Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD).
